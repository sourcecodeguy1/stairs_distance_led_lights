# stairs_distance_led_lights
This code will turn LED lights when Ultra Sonic Sensors are triggered.

You can clone or download the code and modify to your specific needs.

In my application, I'm utilizing two Ultra Sonic Sensors. One for upstairs and one for downstairs. When I walk either down or up stairs, the sensor should be triggered and the LED lights will turn on.
